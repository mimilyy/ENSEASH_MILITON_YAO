### YAO Emilie and MILITON Pierre

## Objectives

The goal of this lab assignment is to create a lightweight shell named enseash, aimed at enhancing our understanding of shell environments and low-level system operations.
This shell will be able to:
- Execute commands and return to the prompt.
- Display the exit status and execution time of each command.
- Support advanced features such as command arguments, input/output redirection, and background process management.

## Answers

  - fd is a file descriptor
  - buf is a pointer to the memory containing the data to be written
  - count is the number of bytes to write from the specified memory location.
